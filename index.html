  <h2>Hi, I'm Ben!</h2>
  <p>I'm a highschool senior. I enjoy reading church history, and practical books. I like taking walks on the GFA world campus. I'm pursuing knowledge, and you'll propably find me drinking tea.</p>
  <h2>My Photo Journey</h2>
  <p>I started taking pictures when I was fourteen years old. I've been trained by Amy and Jordan Demos and I have been inspired a lot by my older brother Scott, who is also a photographer. I like to shoot portrait, landscape, and macro photos. (I also dabble in videography.)</p>
  <h2>Career Highlights</h2>  
  <p>I have taken photos for multiple businesses, including but not limited to: Lake Ellen Camp, Midtown Bait and Tackle, Old Navy, ect...</p>
