      Hi, I'm Ben! I'm Seventeen, I like to shoot portrait, landscape, and macro photos. I also dabble in videography. I grew up serving at a bible camp through doing dishes. I've done dishes in four industrial kitchens in three different states. I'm pursuing knowledge, and you'll propably find me drinking tea.
