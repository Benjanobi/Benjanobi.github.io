  <h2>Hi, I'm Ben!</h2>
  <p>I work in Fulfillment Services at the campus of GFA Worldâ€™s US headquarters in Wills Point, Texas. I help get information about current developmental needs on the mission field to the hands of ministry partners in the West. I run machines that sort, fold paper, and stuff envelopes with the current information provided to us from the national missionaries overseas. My desire is to help my department be as effective as possible in linking financial and prayer partners in the West with national missionaries in Asia and Africa, so that together we can reach those who have never heard the Good News of Jesus Christ. While at GFA World, I hope to grow as a servant to my co-workers and my leadership as Christ has commanded us. 
  <br>I serve at GFA World's US headquarters because I want to share the Gospel of Jesus with the unreached. My desire is to follow the last commandment Jesus gave to his followers before he ascended into heaven to "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you." (Matthew 28:19-20). By serving behind the scenes at GFA World, I'm helping bring the love of Christ to people in Asia and Africa in practical ways such as drilling wells, providing medical care where there is none and helping children in need to receive an education. I believe GFA to be one of the most effective missions organizations because of their wisdom of raising up national missionaries who speak the language of the local people.
  <br>I enjoy reading church history, and practical books. I like taking walks, drawing, learning french, coding, and playing musical instruments such as mandolin or piano. I'm pursuing knowledge, and you'll probably find me drinking tea.</p>
  <h2>My Photo Journey</h2>
  <p>I started taking pictures when I was fourteen years old. I have been trained by Amy and Jordan Demos and I have been inspired a lot by my older brother Scott, who is also a photographer. I like to shoot portrait, landscape, and macro photos. (I also dabble in videography.)</p>
