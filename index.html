<h3>My Photo Journey</h3>

      I started taking pictures when I was fourteen years old. I've been trained by Amy and Jordan Demos and I have been inspired a lot by my older brother Scott, who is also a photographer. I like to shoot portrait, landscape, and macro photos. (I also dabble in videography.)
